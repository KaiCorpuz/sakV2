# SwissArmyKnife
This is SwissArmyKnife by Kai Corpuz.

Elements of this code were given and allowed access by Eric Pogue, specifically HttpRequest, and the method to parse the JSON information, Parse.java

After Demos, I downloaded Zach Offermans repository to reference how to do HttpRequestIndex.
